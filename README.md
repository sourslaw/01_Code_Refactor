![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Description
- The brief for this project is to refactor the existing code for the Horiseon website.

### The User Story for this brief is as follows:
- A marketing agency WANTS a codebase which follows accessibility standards SO THAT the site is optimized for search engines

### The codebase meets the following criteria for acceptance:
- WHEN I view the source code, THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements, THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements, THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes, THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element, THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
